I am Bariscan Kurtkaya.

I work as a Full-Stack Developer at Ollang Media Technologies. I did an internship in the field of artificial intelligence in R&D at AkÄ±m Metal company. In addition, I will go to Universita Degli Studi Di Milano with the artificial intelligence laboratory acceptance I received from Italy in the summer of 2022. I also took part in the artificial intelligence department of the robot team named Cas-Marine and we won 3rd place in Turkey, 3rd place in Teknofest and 4th place in the Undersecretariat of Defense Industry Competition. In addition, my project in the field of image processing in the academic field with TÃ¼bitak 2209-A has been accepted and I am writing a conference article in this field. Apart from that, I am a Core-Team member of the school's Google Developer Student Club.

I'm loving to coding with C, C++, Python and TypeScript. (Little bit assembly but It is mine guilty pleasure :))

I like Image Processing, Neural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, MicroProcessors, Parallel Computing and reading books & papers about them.

I want to go Masters and Doctorate about Computer Science and my biggest dream and target is getting Turing or Nobel Prize. Ssshh this will be our secret :P.
